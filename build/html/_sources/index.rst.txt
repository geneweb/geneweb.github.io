This document is mainly meant to be useful for new developpers, not users.
Some part do quickly explain how geneweb works, so it may be useful for casual users, but it is not the main purpose of the document.
(For geneweb users best documentation is the `geneweb wiki <https://geneweb.tuxfamily.org/wiki/GeneWeb>`_.)
